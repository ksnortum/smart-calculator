# Smart Calculator (Kotlin)

This is project from (HyperSkill)[https://hyperskill.org] that might be of interest to students.  You enter a mathematical expression and it will print the value of it.  Big integers are legal but it doesn't do floating point math and only certain operators are supported.

I've only been coding in Kotlin for a month or so, so that code may not always be very Kotlin-ly.
